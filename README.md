TO DO:

CREATE THE API ENDPOINTS FOR BIDIRECTIONAL MODEL, JUST COPY HOW AND WHAT ARE THE ENDPOINTS FOR THE RIVERCAST MODEL.

BIDIRECTIONAL MODEL SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN DATABASE TABLE FOR "/addPredictionToDB" endpoint AND  "/addTrueValuesToDB" endpoint, PLEASE REFER TO THE RIVERCASTMODELAPI.

TIP: THE 2 MODEL USES THE SAME DATABASE SO, YOU DONT NEED TO CREATE AN ENDPOINT LIKE "/updateModelData" THAT IS IN RIVERCASTMODELAPI,


NOTE: WHEN TESTING, PLEASE DONT RUN THE ENDPOINT /addPredictionToDB AND /addTrueValuesToDB in RIVERCASTMODEL API, 

NOTE: PLEASE IGNORE THE /predict ENDPOINT IN RIVERCASTMODELAPI
